            <h3>CESCian and Football Player </h3>
            <p>I am a student of CESC. I started to study in this from class 3. I wad admitted in this school in 15th
                March,2015. Now I am in class 10. I have spent about 7 years in this school. This school is our second
                home.
                Now
                we are the seniors of the school. After 1 year, we will leave the school by giving our SSC exam. This
                school
                gives us good memories as well as bad memories also. This school has good things as well as bad things.
                I
                still
                remember when I was selected for my house football team for the first time. But unfortunately due to the
                nepotism of the school i couldn't play for the team. But they won the trophy which made me happy. Now I
                have
                been selected for it again and again there is obstacle in front of me. The tournament has been cancelled
                due
                to
                the present omecron situation. But we will play it after this will end and I hope so this time I can
                play
                for
                the team and bring the trophy again. Now I am learning web-development course from Jhankar Mahbub. </p>
